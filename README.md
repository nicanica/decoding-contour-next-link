Space to collaborate on decoding Contour Next Link comms protocols, and the piggy-backed pump comms

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have `python` and `pip` installed
* Clone this project
* If you're running macOS (El Capitan or later), you'll need to update `setuptools` like this first (due to [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204899)):
```
$ sudo -H pip install --upgrade setuptools --user python
```
* Install the dependencies:  
```
$ sudo -H pip install requests hidapi astm transitions PyCrypto crc16 python-dateutil
```
* Plug in your Contour NextLink 2.4 USB stick
* Run ```get_hmac_and_key.py``` to get your HMAC and AES key for your USB stick serial number. This script takes one argument, which is your CareLink username. The script will also ask for your password - this is not echoed out or stored at all.
```
$ python get_hmac_and_key.py my_carelink_username  
Enter the password for the CareLink user my_carelink_username:
HMAC for serial 1055866: e28fe4e5cf3c1eb6d6a2ec5a093093d4f397237dc60b3f2c1ef64f31e32077c4
KEY for serial 1055866: 57833334130906a587b7a0437bc28a69
```

Now whenever you run `read_minimed_next24.py`, the script will get the config from the config database and communicate with your pump.
```
$ python read_minimed_next24.py

## Known Issues
* Assumed pump time was in UTC, but this doesn't ring true for non DST times (in Melbourne, anyway)
